# Drug_Discovery_Challenge

The file titled 'requirements.txt' has the necessary Python package names which are unique to this challenge

# Training and Testing Files

The files titled 'Drug_Discovery.py and ''Drug_Discovery.ipynb' implement the workflow to predict the binding affinity between drug and protein using 3 different machine learning models and one deep learning model. It also has functionality to test the models using external dataset.

The file titled 'Drug_Discovery_OOP.ipynb' has the same code implementation in Object oriented Programming (OOP) format

# Results

The 'best_model.pkl' file is the saved machine learning model that performed best in the validation/internal test dataset

The 'dnn_model.h5' file is the saved deep learning model 

# Additional Information

The details about the model training and development are available in the pythin scripts above (see comments where applicable)
and also the workflow is described on a high level in the powerpoint 'Drug Discovery Challenge_ASHFAQ AHMED.pptx'. 
The powerpoints sheds a picture of what's going under the hood.
